# Forest fire model

This model provides comparisons for cellular automata type ABMs (i.e. when agents do not move and every location in space contains exactly one agent).

NOTE: The Agents.jl implementation of this model has been changed in v4.0 to be directly comparable to Mesa and NetLogo. As a consequence it no longer follows the [original rule-set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forest-fire_model).
